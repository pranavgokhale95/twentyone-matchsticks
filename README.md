# twentyone-matchsticks
A silly matchstick game. Just for fun!

This is a two player game.
Player one - User
Player two - Computer
There are 21 matchsticks in total. A player can pick 1, 2, 3 or 4 matchstick/s at a time. Player one picks up the matchstick/s first. 
The player to pick the last matchstick/s loses.

If you lose, don't worry. It's a silly logical game. I know you will figure out the logic in seconds. That's the whole point-realising how silly the game is!

Have fun!
